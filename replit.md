# Kyrgyzstán Zájezdy

Czech travel agency website for adventure trips to Kyrgyzstan. Customers browse trips, choose 30% deposit or full payment, and pay by card/Google Pay/Apple Pay (Stripe) or Czech QR bank transfer.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (port 8080)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/kyrgyzstan run dev` — run the frontend (port 18438)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- API: Express 5
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- Payments: Stripe (card/Google Pay/Apple Pay), QR bank transfer (Czech SPD standard)
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- Build: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Where things live

- `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml` — API contract (source of truth)
- `lib/db/src/schema/trips.ts` — Trip model
- `lib/db/src/schema/bookings.ts` — Booking model
- `lib/db/src/schema/gallery.ts` — Gallery photo model (trip_id FK)
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/trips.ts` — Trip routes + admin trip routes
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/bookings.ts` — Booking routes + admin booking routes
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/payments.ts` — Stripe checkout, QR payment, Stripe webhook
- `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/gallery.ts` — Gallery routes (public all-trips + per-trip + admin CRUD)
- `artifacts/kyrgyzstan/src/` — React frontend
- `scripts/src/migrate-gallery-trip-id.ts` — Migration script: removes orphaned gallery photos before schema push

## Architecture decisions

- Contract-first OpenAPI spec gates all codegen; frontend and backend share the same types
- Stripe webhook uses raw body middleware (`express.raw`) applied before `express.json`
- QR payment uses Czech SPD standard encoded as QR code (qrcode npm package)
- `depositAmount` is computed in the API layer as `round(price * 0.3)` — not stored in DB
- IBAN and recipient name are configured via env vars (`BANK_IBAN`, `BANK_RECIPIENT_NAME`)

## Product

- Browse Kyrgyzstan adventure trips with images, prices, and descriptions
- Book any trip — choose 30% deposit or full payment
- Pay by card/Google Pay/Apple Pay via Stripe Checkout
- Pay by Czech QR bank transfer (SPD format, 0% fee) — QR shown immediately, confirmation within 24h
- Admin panel at `/admin` — trip management, booking overview, status updates, revenue stats

## User preferences

- Website is in Czech language throughout
- Target market: Czech customers booking trips from Prague

## Deployment (Railway)

The project is configured for Railway. `railway.json` runs `pnpm install && pnpm run build`, then on start runs DB migrations and boots the API server, which **also serves the built frontend** from `artifacts/kyrgyzstan/dist/public` on the same port (no separate frontend service needed).

**Required Railway env vars** (see `.env.example` for the full list):
- `DATABASE_URL` — provided automatically by Railway Postgres plugin
- `SESSION_SECRET` — long random string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `BANK_IBAN`, `BANK_RECIPIENT_NAME`
- `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_REGION`, `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` — any S3-compatible provider (Cloudflare R2 recommended for the free tier)

**After deploy:**
1. Visit `https://<your-railway-domain>/admin` and set the initial admin password (first visitor with no password set becomes admin — do this immediately after deploy before anyone else can)
2. Update your Stripe webhook endpoint to `https://<your-railway-domain>/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Sessions are stored in the `user_sessions` table (auto-created by `connect-pg-simple`)

**SSL note:** the Postgres pool auto-enables SSL when `NODE_ENV=production` (with `rejectUnauthorized: false` to accept Railway's cert). Set `PGSSL=disable` if you ever connect to a local plaintext DB in production mode, or `PGSSL=require` to force it on outside production.

**Migration baseline (only matters if migrating an existing populated DB):**
- The initial migration `lib/db/migrations/0000_*.sql` creates all tables from scratch — safe for a brand-new Railway Postgres
- If you point Railway at a database that already has these tables (e.g. moved from Replit), the boot-time `drizzle-kit migrate` will fail with "relation already exists". To baseline: connect to the DB and insert the first migration into Drizzle's bookkeeping table manually, OR drop the DB and let migrate recreate it (you'll lose data), OR run the migration once locally against an empty DB and copy data over

## Gotchas

- After any OpenAPI spec change, run `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` before editing routes or frontend
- Before pushing `gallery_photos.trip_id` NOT NULL constraint to a DB with existing rows, run `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run migrate-gallery-trip-id` first to delete orphaned photos
- For local dev only, use `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` to sync schema without migration files. For production (Railway), generate migrations with `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run generate` and they will be applied automatically by `migrate` on deploy
- Stripe requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env secrets to work
- To configure your bank account for QR payments, set `BANK_IBAN` and `BANK_RECIPIENT_NAME` env secrets
- For email confirmations (not yet implemented), add `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`
